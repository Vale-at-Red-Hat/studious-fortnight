Ultraviolet Overprinting Pattern
A protective ultraviolet pattern, invisible to the
naked eye, consisting of four lines of “FMS” or
"FISCALSERVICE” bracketed by the “Fiscal
Service” or “Financial Management Service”
seal on the left and United States Seal (eagle)
on the right. This pattern can usually be found
under the payee information and dollar amount
area. The FISCAL SERVICE pattern and seals
can be detected under a black light. If the
amount box is shaved or altered in any way, a
space will be created in the ultraviolet area.
When exposed to black light, the ink used in
the pattern and the seal will glow. This
fluorescent quality cannot be photocopied.
Treasury Seal
The seal identifies the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” or
"Financial Management Service." The previous seal
reflecting “Financial Management Service” will be seen
in rotation until this check stock runs out.
Bleeding Ink
The Treasury seal, located to the right of the Statue of
Liberty, contains security ink that will run and turn red
when moisture is applied to the black ink of the seal.
Microprinting
Microprinted words are so small they appear as just a
line to the naked eye. However, when magnified, they
become visible. Microprinting cannot be duplicated by a
copier and when a check is counterfeited, it will often
show up as a solid line or a series of dots. The U.S.
Treasury check has three areas where microprinting is
used.
Watermark
All U.S. Treasury checks are printed on
watermarked paper. The watermark
reads “U.S. TREASURY” and can be
seen from both the front and back of the
check when held up to a light. The
watermark is light and cannot be
reproduced by a copier. Any check not
having the watermark should be
suspected as being counterfeit or copied.
