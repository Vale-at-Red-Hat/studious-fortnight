  - at the end of the day
  - back to the drawing board
  - hit the ground running
  - get the ball rolling
  - low-hanging fruit
  - thrown under the bus
  - think outside the box
  - let's touch base
  - get my manager's blessing
  - it's on my radar
  - ping me
  - i don't have the bandwidth
  - no brainer

  - bang for your buck
  - synergy
  - move the goal post
  - apples to apples
  - win-win
  - circle back around
  - all hands on deck
  - take this offline
  - drill-down
  - elephant in the room
  - on my plate
