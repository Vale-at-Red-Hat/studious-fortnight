# Vale at Red Hat Blog

## 16. May, 1:22 PM, Sunday

Rolfe: This weekend, I merged a large number of updates  into the studious-fortnight repo. These included:
- Removing the previous `/styles` folder and `.vale.ini` file.
- Adding the `.vale` styles folder and `.vale.ini` that Fabrice and Yana developed for the Che eclipse documentation project.
- Updating and expanding `README.md` with new information to help you get started with using Vale.
- Adding a "Troubleshooting common errors" topic to help newcomers identify and correct common issues.

I'm also adding this blog page.
