# Studious-fortnight repository

This repository helps tech writers at Red Hat get up and running with Vale. It serves as the starting point for the Vale Community of Practice at Red Hat.

## Understanding `vale` usage

As a technical writer, you typically run `vale` on the command-line against a content file:

----
$ cd openshift-docs/logging/troubleshooting/
$ vale cluster-logging-troubleshooting-for-critical-alerts.adoc
----

The resulting command output gives you a list of suggestions, warnings, and errors based on customizable styles and vocabularies.

                      &apos;rebalancing&apos;?

                      are&apos; with the word usage                            
                      guidelines.

                      rather than &apos;present&apos;</pre>

Understanding the `vale` command output example:

First column:: The line and character number of the issue, such as `244:6`.
Second column:: The type of issue, such as `error`, `suggestion`, or `warning`.
Third column:: The style prompt: `Verify your use of 'there are'`
Fourth column:: Source of the rule, such as `IBM.Usage`

As a writer, you review output, decide which issues are valid, and update your content accordingly.

What if the command output from Vale is wrong?::
For example, the word `rebalancing` appears in Red Hat's products (it does) and it's also a dictionary word? But, with standard Vale configuration, it is showing up as an error.
It is missing from the Vale default dictionary. To fix the error, add the missing term to the list of allowed words. More precisely in the `.vale/styles/RedHat/accept.txt` file. See link:https://docs.errata.ai/vale/vocab[Vale Vocabularies documentation]  This brings us to:

## Getting started with vale

. Install the Vale command-line tool on your workstation. See link:https://docs.errata.ai/vale/install[Installing Vale].
+
NOTE: On the Vale site, click the tab for your operating system.

. Use `git clone` to copy this repository, studious-fortnight, to your local environment. 
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:rolfedh/studious-fortnight.git
----

. Add vale configuration to your `$HOME` directory to use vale with the configuration in this repository on any project in your local environment. Add a symbolic link to the `.vale` directory and the `.vale.ini` file.
+
----
$ cd studious-fortnight
$ ln -s .vale.ini $HOME/
$ ln -s .vale $HOME/
----

. Add the vale configuration to the project to add project-specific rules, or simplify vale usage by anyone in a project, including continuous integration. Copy the `.vale.ini` file and `.vale` directory from the `studious-fortnight` directory to the `__<project_directory>__` directory containing your documentation project.
+
[]
----
$ cd studious-fortnight
$ cp -r .vale* __<project_directory>__/
----

. Run the `vale` command on one of your content files.
+
----
$ cd __<project_directory>__
$ vale __<filename>__
----

. Review the vale output and use it to update your content file.

. Re-run the same `vale` command to see the updated results.
+
WARNING: The styles are not perfect and not complete. Don't be discouraged by the vale output. Review the output and decide what is useful to you, given the maturity of your project. Embracing a linter in a project is a long journey.

////
## Optional: Eliminating false positives

. Run the `vale` command on multiple content files by using a wildcard character `*`. For example:
----
$ vale modules/cluster-logging-exported*.adoc
----

2. Review the output for `Vale.Spelling` errors for valid words, such as words that appear in the product.

5. Add those valid words to `~/.vale/styles/Vocab/Red-Hat/accept.txt`.
