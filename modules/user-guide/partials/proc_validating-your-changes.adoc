= Validating your changes

WIP - Work in progress - WIP

As a pull request author or reviewer, you need a way to validate that the changes work and don't generate false positives.

You do this by doing the following:
* Getting the changes on your local machine
* Redirecting vale to use the changes
* Running vale against a local documentation repo
* Reviewing the results
