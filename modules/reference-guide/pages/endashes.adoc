= En dashes

Use an link:https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2013[En dash] (`â€“`) to show a range of numbers.
Do not use spaces before or after the En dash.

[NOTE]
====
An link:https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2014[Em dash] (`-`) is not the same as an En dash.
The Em dash works like a comma, a colon, or parenthesis.
